## Workflow

![Flow](img/py-package-download-forecast.png)

Generates best ARIMA model every week based on the latest data from **PyPI Stats API**. The model training happens on the recent data and forecast is done for next 30 days.

Github artifact is used to store the models. The Gradio application hosted in HugginFace Spaces calls the [Github Artifact API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/artifacts?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-artifacts-for-a-repository) to download the latest set of models.

> Note: The artifact retention days is set to 30 and can be configured from the project settings
